# Image Processing in Python

A simple Python project demonstrating basic image processing:

- Resize the image to half its original size  
- Convert the image to grayscale  
- Rotate the image by 90°  
- Display the original and processed images side by side  
- Print the pixel matrices and their dimensions

## How to Run

1. Make sure the image `plane.jpg` is in the same folder as `task1.py`.  
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install --user Pillow numpy matplotlib

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
